Large wooden steamers were clearly helpless against smaller armour-plated foes.\nIronclads were fighting ironclads. Perhaps most significantly, the Americans had produced\nthem in far less time and expense than either England or France.&quot; [1]<p>Lord Lyons (British ambassador the U.S.) wrote to Lord Russel (Foreign Secretary), &quot;This is, I suppose, the severest test to which the system of coating vessels in iron armour has yet been exposed.&quot;<p>Admiral Milne, head of the British North Atlantic Squadron was &quot;agog&quot; at the results. Commander Hewett of HMS <i>Rinaldo</i> actually watched the battle and had the same <em>reactio</em>n.<p>What was proved was that the weapons system of wooden ships-of-the-line was obsolete. Ironclads were now conclusively the future.<p>[1] &quot;Seagoing purposes indispensable to the defence of this\ncountry:&quot; Policy Pitfalls of Great Britain's Early Ironclads",
